SETTING UP:

Before you get started, run these commands in Python:
	'pip install canvasapi'
	'pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client oauth2client'
	
	
For Google Tasks, the program will automatically ask for authentication, provided you have a 'credentials.json' file from Google API Console.

You can get a key here: https://developers.google.com/tasks/quickstart/python
(STOP AFTER STEP 2)

After placing 'credentials.json' into your directory and installing both Google's auth client,
Head to your Canvas account settings and request an API key.

In Canvas:
-(Account -> Settings -> Approved Integrations -> New Access Token)
-Name the purpose 'Canvas-2-GTasks' (Any name works too)
-Copy your key and keep it handy

After getting your Google and Canvas credentials, run the program. Have the Canvas API key ready when prompted.
